# Sales Forecasting & Inventory Optimisation for FMCG Retail

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive, data-driven solution for mid-sized FMCG and Retail companies. By leveraging advanced time series forecasting techniques and inventory optimisation algorithms, the project delivers actionable insights to reduce stockouts and prevent oversupplyâ€”thereby increasing profitability and operational efficiency.

Using the **Rossmann Store Sales** dataset from Kaggle, the project demonstrates how historical sales data combined with predictive modeling can transform inventory management practices, paving the way for smarter business decisions and consulting services.

## Problem Statement
Retailers face constant challenges balancing inventory with fluctuating demand. This project addresses those challenges by:
- **Forecasting Sales:** Predicting daily sales trends with high accuracy.
- **Optimising Inventory:** Recommending ideal stock levels to minimize waste and lost sales.
- **Driving Business Impact:** Providing strategic insights that enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Rossmann Store Sales on Kaggle  
  ðŸ”— [Rossmann Store Sales on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales)
- **Content:**  
  - Daily sales records for over 1,000 stores
  - **Features:** Store details, promotions, holidays, competition data, sales figures, open/closed status, etc.
- **Usage:** The dataset enables robust time series analysis and serves as a foundation for generating actionable inventory optimisation recommendations.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
  Raw data is cleansed, missing values are addressed, and data types are converted appropriately. Additional featuresâ€”such as moving averages, seasonal trends, and promotional indicatorsâ€”are engineered to enhance model performance.
  
- **Time Series Forecasting:**  
  Advanced models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) are applied to predict future sales trends based on historical data. Techniques like backtesting and cross-validation ensure robust model validation.

- **Inventory Optimisation:**  
  Forecast outputs are integrated with optimisation algorithms to suggest optimal inventory levels that align with predicted demand, balancing cost with service levels.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Prophet, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab for interactive analysis  
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for collaborative development and portfolio presentation

## Results & Business Impact
- **Improved Forecast Accuracy:** Enhanced prediction accuracy reduces excess inventory and mitigates stockouts.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Optimised inventory recommendations translate to significant cost savings and improved stock management.
- **Consulting Value:** The insights and methodologies demonstrated here can directly benefit retail clients, showcasing the potential for data-driven consulting services.
